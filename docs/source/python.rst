Python prerequisites
--------------------

Take these situations :

- Where
- Why
- How

  + now
  + never
  + sometime

Thus, you see, ``pull`` is in intricate affair.

Take this equation 

.. math:: 
  
   a^2 + b^2 = \dfrac{2}{c^2}

-----

:guilabel: `Open Model`

.. code:: python

   import os
   print(help(os))

.. danger::

   This is only a learning test-bed.  
   Take nothing that's here seriously

.. rubric::  Let's play some games

Take :math:`a = b + 2` as a small equation, 
and calcualte :math:`a` when :math:`b = 5` !


Admonitions
-----------

**Admonitions** are ways to include texx-box
(as in :math:`\text{\LaTeX}`).

They can be of the following types---

.. attention:: Attracting attention of the reader

   To draw focus of a reader to a particular
   text, this admonition can be well used to 
   have a good effect.
   


.. caution:: If you want to warn the reader

   Suppose there's a word of caution for the reader
   that you want to print with coloured text-box.
   This is simply the way out.


.. danger:: Dangerous items to be put here

   When you warn the reader of some potential 
   danger, then this admonition is the best way
   to do that.  It's like a 440 Volt sign on 
   the road.


.. error:: Error messages or error texts


.. hint:: Hints to problems

   This comes in handy for very complex problems
   which practically cannot be solved without 
   a small hint.


.. important:: Important matter here !

   Wow !  Bringing important matter with raised
   focus is one of the duties of a good documentation.


.. note:: Notes are most common Admonitions.

   People use this place to say something that 
   has to be kept in mind, whether the main 
   matter is well understood or not.


.. tip:: Tips are very similar to Hints.


.. warning:: Warning and Caution should be

   synonymous, I suppose !


.. seealso:: Pointing to something that's 

   extra--- over and above the plain text.
