Python prerequisites
--------------------

Take these situations :

- Where
- Why
- How

  + now
  + never
  + sometime

Thus, you see, ``pull`` is in intricate affair.

Take this equation 

.. math:: 
  
   a^2 + b^2 = \dfrac{2}{c^2}

-----

:guilabel: `Open Model`

.. code:: python

   import os
   print(help(os))

.. danger::

   This is only a learning test-bed.  
   Take nothing that's here seriously

.. rubric::  Let's play some games

Take :math:`a = b + 2` as a small equation, 
and calcualte :math:`a` when :math:`b = 5` !


Admonitions
-----------

**Admonitions** are ways to include texx-box
(as in :math:`\text{\LaTeX}`).

They can be of the following types---

.. attention:: Attracting attention of the reader

   To draw focus of a reader to a particular
   text, this admonition can be well used to 
   have a good effect.
   


.. caution:: If you want to warn the reader

   Suppose there's a word of caution for the reader
   that you want to print with coloured text-box.
   This is simply the way out.


.. danger:: Dangerous items to be put here

   When you warn the reader of some potential 
   danger, then this admonition is the best way
   to do that.  It's like a 440 Volt sign on 
   the road.


.. error:: Error messages or error texts


.. hint:: Hints to problems

   This comes in handy for very complex problems
   which practically cannot be solved without 
   a small hint.


.. important:: Important matter here !

   Wow !  Bringing important matter with raised
   focus is one of the duties of a good documentation.


.. note:: Notes are most common Admonitions.

   People use this place to say something that 
   has to be kept in mind, whether the main 
   matter is well understood or not.


.. tip:: Tips are very similar to Hints.


.. warning:: Warning and Caution should be

   synonymous, I suppose !


.. seealso:: Pointing to something that's 

   extra--- over and above the plain text.


----

.. sidebar:: Margine notes with ``.. sidebar::``

   A lot of text can be summarized in an 
   American*ish* style with sidebar contents.

You can write long, long, long paragraphs...
Like a story of your childhood, or the memory
of an event you saw when you were eighteen
that took you not only by surprise, but 
came to your reminiscence several times in
your life.  These events are to be given some
importance, and even can creep into your dreams
once in a lifetime. But I'd say it's best to
ignore such thoughts.

.. note:: Ignore memory-recurring events.
